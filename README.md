# Game Automation with Hand Gestures

Automate car game using Python and real-time gesture recognition with the Mediapipe library, allowing players to control the game by gestures.


### Programming Language
Python is our preferred programming language. It is the perfect choice for implementing the hand gesture controls in the car racing automation project due to its adaptability, readability, and extensive libraries, especially CV2, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, that provide powerful capabilities for computer vision and real-time gesture recognition.
