# Game Automation with Hand Gestures

Automate car game using Python and real-time hand gesture recognition with the Mediapipe library, allowing players to control acceleration and braking by opening or closing their fingers.


### Programming Language
Python is our prefferd programming language. Because it is the perfect choice for implementing the hand gesture controls in the Hill Climb Racing automation project due to its adaptability, readability, and extensive libraries, especially CV2, OpenCV and Mediapipe, that provide powerful capabilities for computer vision and real-time gesture recognition.
